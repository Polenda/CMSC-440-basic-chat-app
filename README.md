## Description

This project is all about makign a prototype for a mobile application designed and development by myself. Through a 5 week process we attempt to follow the basics step of app development to create a 1-page app as a proof of concept.

The steps for ths project:

- [ ] Homework 7 - Pitch
- [ ] Homework 8 - Storyboard
- [X] Homework 9 - 1-Screen App
- [ ] Homework 10 - Navigation and Components
- [ ] Homework 11 - Interactivity

For this step I took all of the aspects of the pitch to create a functional storyboard of the app. Attempting to make a sketch of the apps design whilst still keeping the design philosophy outlined in the first homework. The functionality of the app is the minimum of navigating between each page of the app, not including pop-up sections.

## How To:

Navigate to where you want your repo.

``` cd ~/path/to/repo/ ```

Clone the repo.

``` git clone repo /Polenda/CMSC-440-basic-chat-app ```

### Server Setup:

Initializing ChatServer.py replacing [port] with the port of your choice.

``` python ChatServer.py [port] ```

Wait for the server to inform you of its start where it provides you with the IP and port.

### Client Setup:

Once the server is up, initialize ChatClient.py and replace [ip] and [port] from the info provided in ClientServer.py then replace [nickname] and [id] with your choice: id is in format ###

``` python ChatClient.py [ip] [port] [nickanme] [id] ```
